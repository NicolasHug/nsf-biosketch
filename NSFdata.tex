Plans for data management and sharing of the products of research.\\ 

Proposals must include a supplementary document of no more than
two pages labeled ``Data Management Plan''. This supplement should
describe:

\begin{enumerate}
\item the types of data, samples, physical collections, software, curriculum
    materials, and other materials to be produced in the course of the project;
evaluation of classifiers
evaluation of parameter ranges
evaluation using GPs
evaluation of preprocessing methods and pipelines

source code as part of scikit-learn
source code as additional package

data on usage of models via github (??)
data on adoption of new methds


documentation of code

documentation of evaluation procedure etc (how data was collected)

\item the standards to be used for data and metadata format and content (where
    existing standards are absent or deemed inadequate, this should be
    documented along with any proposed solutions or remedies);

??

\item policies for access and sharing including provisions for appropriate
    protection of privacy, confidentiality, security, intellectual property, or
    other rights or requirements;

code accessible on Github under BSD license
data hosted on ??? under CC-0 license
result data also hosted on openml via their platform!!!
documentation of code with the code, accessible on website
documentation of method accessible with new package


all but data will be updated constantly

\item policies and provisions for re-use, re-distribution, and the production
    of derivatives; and

\item plans for archiving data, samples, and other research products, and for
    preservation of access to them.

\end{enumerate}

% explicitly talk about documentation etc
% talk about sphinx etc
%  dublin core metadata format xml
% meta-data and data in arff from openml (explicitly file format)
% doing processing in python
% data embargo for publication.
% nyu data retention?
% explicitly say what metadata schema is.

figshare: doi, digital preservation (upload limit 5gig per file)
no limit in osf.

json files + schema?

tell workflow of the project
and who does this.

long term preservation: community of developers
