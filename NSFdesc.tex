\required{Project Description}
\subsection{Introduction}
As sciences move towards more data driven research, data analysis has
become a main building block of many research disciplines.
Many advances in recent research have been driven by algorithmic improvements
in data analysis, in particular in predictive analystics and machine learning.
[FIXME examples, cite?]
As machine learning becomes a tool for scientists accross disciplines, it is
important that this analytical tools are freely available, and easy to use for
domain scientists outside of the field of machine learning.

The scikit-learn machine learning library provides machine learning functunality
within the established -- but still growing -- scientific python ecosystem.
Scikit-learn is an open source library written in Python, implementing state-of-the-art
machine learning algorithm and utilities to apply these algorithms to real-world
data analysis and prediction problems.

The distinguishing features of scikit-learn are its generic and intuitive
interface, its comprehensiveness and its documentation.

\emph{Interface} Scikit-learn provides a generic interface for machine learning, mainly consisting
of only three methods: fit, to build models, predict, to make predictions using models,
and transform, to change the representation of the input data.
This simple and consistent interface helps to abstract away the algorithm, and let
users focus on their particular problem. It also allows replacing an algorithm by another
by changing a single line of code.
Scikit-learn utilizes the well-established NumPy library to represent data and predictions.
NumPy is used across domains for numeric computations, and integrating this generic
representation into scikit-learn minimizes the friction of applying machine learning
within an existing project.

\emph{Comprehensiveness} Scikit-learn implements a wide variety of models for classification,
regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction, as well as methods for feature
selection and feature extraction. The library contains most of the algorithms included
in standard textbooks like FIXME bishop and ESL, while providing competitive implementation
of state-of-the-art algorithms like Gradient Boosting, Random Forests and SAG FIXME.
In addition to a large selection of algorithms, scikit-learn also contains a suite
of evaluation metrics and tools for parameter selection.

\emph{Documentation}
Documentation is a key ingredient to usability, and the documentation of scikit-learn
has been widely recognized as a useful resource FIXME. The scikit-learn project
has strict rules on documentation and requires examples and extensive descriptions
for all algorithms.

These features lead to a wide-spread use of scikit-learn, and the FIXME of a large
ecosystem of users, contributors, maintainers and dependent packages.

\subsection{Previous impact of the scikit-learn package}
The scikit-learn project has been widely used in academic and industrial research,
and has made its way into multiple commercial products. The paper describing scikit-learn
has been cited 2720 according to google scholar. Applications of scikit-learn spread
a multitude of research areas, including FIXME Physics, Astronomy,
Biology, Medicine, Psychology, Cyber Security, Oceanograpy, Sociology and more.

The mailing list has X subscribers, with on average X mails per month.

\subsection{Proposed Work}
Despite the extensive documentation, applying machine learning using scikit-learn
still requires expert knowledge about:
what kind of models to use for a given task
what kind of feature extraction and preprocessing is required for a model
and what parameters to tune, and in which ranges

While it is easy for a scientist to create a working model, this model might not
be optimum, and they could obtain a much better model using more expert knowledge
in machine learning.
However, the need for this expert knowledge can be eliminated at least partially
using recent developments in model selection and meta-learning.

Funding form this proposal would enable a concentrated effort to include more
automatic model selection in scikit-learn, and therefore lower the barrier to
entry for applying machine learning even further.

The components of the proposed work are
- Improving the existing pipelining facilities for more automatic feature extraction.
- Provide explicit sets of parameters to tune for each algorithm, together with recommended ranges.
- Integrate methods for Bayesian optimization for parameter selection.
- Integrate meta-learning for automatic model selection.

\subsection{Intellectual Merit}
Improving automation in model selection and preprocessing in scikit-learn will have far-reaching
implications for existing and future applications of machine learning.
Research projects that already use scikit-learn for machine learning will be able to adapt better
models with minimal changes to their workflow, potentialy improving their research outcomes.
For research projects that are not relying on machine learning yet, including a model
from scikit-learn will be much easier and require much less expert knowledge.

Developing more automated model selection requires extensive benchmarking and evaluation
on a diverse array of machine learning problems. Such a large scale evaluation,
in the spirit of FIXME and autosklearn FIXME? can provide important insights into
the state of the art in machine learning, and will result in improved infrastructure
for large scale studies of algorithms.

\required{The scikit-learn package and ecosystem}
The scikit-learn machine learning library is an open source library for the
Python programming language, distributed under a BSD license.
It is developed largely by a community of volunteers, with some support from
Inria FIXME, Telecom ParisTech and through PI Mueller as part of the
Moore-Sloan Data Science Environment at NYU.
The package was first released in 2010, and new releases are made semi-annually.
The development team has 38 members, and releases and project management are
coordinated between PI Mueller and Olivier Grisel at FIXME.
There have been approximately 670 contributors to the project so far, demonstrating
the wide community engagement, with each release typically including changes
from 100 and 150 contributors.

\subsection{Project Description}
The scikit-learn project focusses on effective and easy to use implementation
of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms that are usefull for a wide
audience of machine learning practitioners in research and commercial applications.
Implemented algorithms include Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting,
Non-Negative Matrix factorization, Independent Component Analysis, K-Means, DBSCAN, Isomap,
t-SNE and many others. To facilitate easy evaluation and model selection, scikit-learn
implements metrics like the the R^2, AUC, Adjusted Rand score, Mutual information, Average precision
and many more. Additionally, a framework for cross-validation and parameter selection is
provided, allowing parameter tuning with very little effort.

Given that scikit-learn is mostly developed and maintained by volunteers,
one of the core principles of scikit-learn is to lower the barrier for new developers,
and keep the complexity of the code as low as possible, to simplify maintenance.
The success of this approach can be seen in the large number of contributors to
the project.

\subsection{Interface and extensibility}
The simple interface of scikit-learn has received FIXME praise for its design and user-friendlyness.
The main functionality of machine learning models can be summarized using just three functions:

fit for building models

predict for creating predictions

transform for generating new representations.

Creating a custom model or preprocessing method using this interface is very simple,
and a way in which many users extend the functionality. The scikit-learn documentation
has comprehensive documentation on the conventions and interfaces in scikit-learn,
to promote the creation of custom extensions.
The scikit-learn library even has a generic test framework that allows users to
test their own implementation against the behavior expected by scikit-learn.

\subsection{Impacts in research}
Scikit-learn has had an impact first in the field of machine learning,
where it continues to provide a baseline for comparison, as well as a
framework in which to develop and evaluate new methods.
The much broader omni-disciplinary impact is in providing easy-to-use
tools for solving machine learning tasks. By providing a collection
of methods with a simple and consistent interface, researchers
can easily explore different solutions to their machine learning problems,
with a large collection of well-tested and well-established algorithms
at their finger tips.
The adoption of scikit-learn in research can be seen in the large number
of citations (FIXME according to google scholar) as well as in the development
of more domain specific solutions build on scikit-learn.
According to the email addresses used for contributions, researchers and students
from at least 23 US universities \emph{contributed} to scikit-learn, indicating wide-spread use.

\subsection{Impacts in education}
In addition to being widely used as a toolkit by practitioners,
Scikit-learn is also popular in teaching machine learning.
The emphasis on accessibility, usability and documentation within
the scikit-learn project makes it ideal for an introductory
course in machine learning, and allows access to a wide variety
of algorithms. Scikit-learn is particularly popular in teaching
"Data Science" courses that focus on making inferences about
a particular data set, rather than the mathematics that go into
particular ways to solve machine learning problems.
Data Science courses are usually targeted at a broad spectrum
of students with mixed backgrounds, providing them
with the data analysis tools useful across domains.

Courses using scikit-learn have been tought at universities
including NYU, Brown, Duke, Berkeley, Stanford, Princeton,
Columbia, University of Pensilvania, Georgetown University, Cornell
and others. FIXME names spelling / naming.


\subsection{Reproducibility, democratization and openness}
An important contribution of scikit-learn has been in providing a common
ground for scientists to base their research on. Reimplementing
and algorithm from a text book or the description in a paper is often not
straight-forward, and slight differences in implementation details can
lead to different learning outcomes. By providing shared, open and 
accessible infrastructure that is used by many research groups,
scikit-learn facilitates reproducibility of algorithmic results.
