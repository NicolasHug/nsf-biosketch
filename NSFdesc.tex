\required{Project Description}

% From the NSF Grants Proposal Guide:
% "The Project Description should provide a clear statement of the work 
% to be undertaken and must include: objectives for the period of the proposed 
% work and expected significance; relation to longer-term goals of the PI's 
% project; and relation to the present state of knowledge in the field, 
% to work in progress by the PI under other support and to work in progress 
% elsewhere."

\required{Broader Impacts of the Proposed Work}
% as in the project summary, broader impacts must be called out separately 
% in the project description.  You may be able to give more specific
% examples, or discuss how you've previously achieved these impacts.

\required{Results From Prior NSF Support}
% 5 pages or fewer of the 15 pages for entire description document.
% include a summary of results of the completed work, 
% including accomplishments,supported from NSF grants received 
% in the past 5 years.
% if supported by more than one grant, choose the most relevant one
% for each grant, include: the title of the project, NSF award number, amount, dates of
% support, and publications resulting from this research.
% due to space limitations, it is often advisable to use citations rather
% than putting the titles of the publications in the body 
% of this section

% e.g.: "My prior grant, "Uses of Coffee in Mathematical Research" (DMS-0123456, 
% $100,000, 2005-2008), resulted in 3 papers [1],[2],[3], demonstrating..."
