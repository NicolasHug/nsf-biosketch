Machine learning is a central component in many data-driven research areas, but
it's adoption is limited by the often complex choice of data processing, model,
and hyper-parameter settings.
The goal of this project is to create software tools that enable automatic machine learning,
that is solving predictive analytics tasks without requiring the user to explicitly
specify the algorithm or model hyper-parameters used for prediction.
The software developed in this will enable a wider use of machine learning, by
providing tools to apply machine learning without requiring knowledge of the
details of the algorithms involved.

The project extends the existing scikit-learn project, a machine learning library
for Python, which is widely used in academic research across disciplines.
The project will add features to this library to lower the amount of expert knowledge
required to apply models to a new problem, and to facilitate the interaction with
automated machine learning systems.
The project will also create a separate software package that includes models
for automatic supervised learning, with a very simple interface, requiring
minimal user interaction. In contrast to existing research projects, this project
focusses on creating easy-to-use tools that can be used by researchers without
extensive training in machine learning or computer science.
