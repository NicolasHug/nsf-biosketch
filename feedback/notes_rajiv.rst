============

questions:
how much can I pay a software developer?

industry collaborations?


doi?

good fit
sse or ssi

make it strong
show objective evidence of usage (citations)
who used?
registered users (mailing list)

letter of commitment from users

just two lines
"i coomit"
these users have commited to be early adopters
who need that

disadvantage?
academic
industry is plus but cant be the reason

outside of us is valuable
nsf is US
international workshop payed by their country
or do workshop abroad

all about software dev. if risk of new features is high, not a good fit
not core research

only maintenance is worse or better?
this is seed fund, not long term support.
(should be weening off).
this is to establish, not sustain.

how are you closer to sustainability if this is only maintenance?


cofounded by many divisions.
aci is especially interested in .. that is

Research components:
publishable outcomes.
enrich your academic portfolio.
collect data on software engineering paper etc.
usability, study in a systematic manner. aci paper...
adoption data ...

part of software development is investigating broader area.
well integrated with development and adoption.
or should be small component.

reflective practice (<- personal comment)

tries to extract generalizable insight from work that you already do.

cofounded by other directories. the more I'll be able to sell to small
number of other domains so that the program directors in other devisions get onboard.

reach out to those directorates. (physics / astro)_

if software developers are not body for hire, but can break into academic
system.
research engineer.

IMPORTANT
=========

how is this sustainable if you need to hire professionals at market rates.



companies can commit time and get advice from team.
