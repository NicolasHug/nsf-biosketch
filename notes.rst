A competitive SI2 proposal will:

    Describe application areas in science or engineering where the identified
    software is needed, and how the use of the identified software will have a
    significant impact on science and engineering research;

    Describe the targeted user communities of the proposed software and how
    they will be engaged; and

    Provide a compelling discussion of the software's potential use by a wider
    audience and its contribution to a national cyberinfrastructure.


Scientific Software Elements (SSE): SSE awards target small groups that will
create and deploy robust software elements for which there is a demonstrated
need; these elements will in turn advance one or more significant areas of
science and engineering. It is expected that the created software elements will
be designed so as to demonstrate potential for addressing issues of
sustainability, manageability, usability and interoperability, and will be
disseminated into the community as reusable software resources. The development
approach may support the hardening of early prototypes and/or expanding
functionality to increase end user relevance.
